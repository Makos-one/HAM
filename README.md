Step project HAM
HTML, CSS, JS
The layout is made without using CSS libraries such as Bootstrap or Materialize.

- The layout is made for widescreen monitors with a screen width of 1200 pixels or more (i.e. the width of the content is fixed in pixels). 
- the maximum width of the content container is 1160 pixels (except for the second block with squares).
- the background image in the header should occupy the entire available width of the screen and not move when scrolling down (parallax effect).
- clickable links in the "Breaking news" section.
- Dynamic elements on the page:
*Tabs in the "Our services" section switch when you click with the mouse. 
*The "Load more" button in the "Our amazing work" section simulates downloading new images from the server. When you click it, more images appear in the section below, and then the button disappears.
*The buttons on the "Our amazing work tab" are "product filters". 
Each of the images is assigned to one of four categories, and when you click on a category button, only the images that belong to that category are displayed. "All" shows images from all categories. 
- the carousel on the "What people say about theHam" tab is working, by clicking both on the photo icon at the bottom and the right-left arrows. Both the picture and the text will change in the carousel. Carousel with animation.
